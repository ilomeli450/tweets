* TODO: 1-2 description of how you organized your code for the assignment
My code was organized according to Unit Testing. Functions were implemented separate from the tests for those functions. Each function implemented was partitioned and tested appropriately. I tried to test each function individually to zero in on bugs.
* TODO: Number of hours it took you to complete the assignment
It took me 10 hours to complete the assignment.
* TODO: One thing you found annoying, interesting or challenging about the assignment
I was intimidated at first by regular expressions but now I think they are really cool and useful!
